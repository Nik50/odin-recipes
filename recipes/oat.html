        <li>
            Put a small saucepan on fire and pour some water into it, depending on your preferred consistency.
            If you want a flowing consistency, let the water be more and if you want it to be thick, reduce the water.
        </li>
        <li>Add the salt and oats to the water and stir. Donâ€™t let the water heat before you put in the oats otherwise it can stick together.</li>
        <li>Leave it to cook for about ten minutes.</li>
        <li>When it is ready, pour it into a bowl. Add sugar and milk, garnish with some almonds and serve. The sugar, milk and almonds are optional.</li>
